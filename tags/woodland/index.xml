      <description>Objectives #  To find suitable sites within the Snowdonia National Park for provenance trials with walnut trees.
The trees are to be grown for timber and fruit and contribute to sustainable and biodiverse land use systems with structured woodland corridors.

Less favoured areas are over 240 metres, a category of hills and uplands which are less suitable for arable farming and prime pasture.</description>
