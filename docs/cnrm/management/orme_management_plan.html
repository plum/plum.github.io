The plan meets, as far as resources allow, the requirements of the site and your organisation. Brief maps accompany the text. Ordnance survey maps are useful. Full plans may be referred to, held at the Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) offices.</p>
<p>Management planning has been regarded as a continuous, adaptable, long-term process. The adaptable process enables conservation managers to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Take account of, and respond to, the varying factors that affect the features.</li>
<li>Continually develop or refine management processes.</li>
<li>Demonstrate whether or not management is appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>A confirmed list of features for management purposes has been drawn up with due regard to previously recognised conservation features, according to designations of a local, national,or international, kind. The plan also includes Country Park features in order to meet Country Park objectives. Appropriate management is implemented with respect to each feature
The features are monitored in order to determine whether or not the current condition meets the required condition. Shortfalls are recorded. Where objectives are not being met, the management processes are reviewed, and if necessary modified. Occasionally, it may be necessary to modify the objectives. The cycle is repeated at appropriate intervals.</p>
<p>No one individual possesses sufficient expertise in all areas, and opinion is sought. The plan is produced with team effort and overall responsibility for the production of the plan rests with the site manager. Where consultants are employed, this is in consultation with the site manager.</p>

<h3>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary Description</h3>
<p>National Grid Reference:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>SH 767 833</li>
</ul>
<p>The Great Orme is a headland surrounded by sea, connected to the mainland by a causeway, situated in the community of Llandudno in the county of Conwy The site is bounded by cliffs, farmland, municipal gardens, residential developments and the sea coast.</p>
<p>The Great Orme is a syncline of Carboniferous Limestone comprising 314 ha., its cliffs rise from sea level to 207 m. (679 ft.) at its summit, and of sufficient interest to be included in the national Geological Conservation Review (GCR).</p>
<p>There are a number of freshwater springs and wells on the headland, which is characterised by intricate inter-grading zones of mainly calcicolous grassland and heath. Areas of limestone pavement and scrub also occur, in addition to two areas of mixed ash woodland, which are probably ancient. The site is rich native in flora and fauna of conservation interest. There are also underground mines.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="designation">
<h3>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designation</h3>
<p>The vast majority, 321 ha. of the site, is included within the SSSI and Nature Conservation Review (NCR). 309 hectares are candidate Special Area of Conservation (cSAC) Natura 2000 site. A Local Nature Reserve (LNR) boundary of 151 hectares was defined in 1981 in order to include all prime sites of biological or geological importance and, as far as practical, match that of the Country Park boundary of 291 hectares. 7 km is defined as Heritage coast.</p>
<p>Some independent businesses on the Gt. Orme, for example the Summit Complex and Rectory Tea Gardens, are situated outside the designations of Country Park and Local Nature Reserve, but within the same area boundaries: Refer to Map: <em>'Great Orme, Overlapping Designations').</em></p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="past-land-use-history">
<h3>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past Land-Use History</h3>
<p>Archaeological evidence of human occupation dates back to the Upper Palaeolithic. The Viking influence that spread throughout the Irish Sea is evident in the name Orme (Norse: ' Great serpent'), and in coinage of King Cnut found in the church.</p>
<p>Enclosure had advanced by the Mid 18th century. Un-enclosed land (218 ha) in 1840 was held in common by the Bishop of Bangor, transferred to private ownership by a parliamentary enclosure award in 1848.</p>
<p>Sheep rearing has been prevalent agriculture on un-enclosed land for over 2 centuries prior to the Great Orme becoming a Victorian recreational area. With the decline of the copper industry, after 1843. A golf course after WWI, the land became farmland in WW2. The site had been used by a small number of local people for hunting and shooting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="present-use">
<h3>3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Present Use</h3>
<p>There are no common rights on the Country Park. The County Borough Council, as manager of the land, has rights of access to all parts of the site. Management of the Country Park and Local Nature Reserve since 1980 has sought to promote conservation, public recreation or enjoyment and education. The Great Orme's head, a resort since Victorian times, attracts a large number of visitors. The site is open access to the public. Visitors can gain access to the summit of the site by motor vehicle, a cable car, Victorian tramway, or public footpath.</p>
<p>Great Orme's Head is of low agricultural quality, with a little arable land. The majority of the site is sheep grazed by Mr. J T Jones of Parc Farm (Great Orme). The grazing density, now 1.4 sheep per hectare, has declined over the past 20 years from the order of 1,000 down to 416 sheep. The sheep are grazed all year round, with about nine weeks of gathering onto the improved pasture land for weaning (August), shearing (June), tupping (October) and lambing (March). There is a herd of grazing feral goats.</p>
<p>Private land on the headland is mainly used for either residential (nearer the town of Llandudno) or agricultural purposes, these lie outside the Country Park and LNR boundaries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="zones">
<h3>3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zones</h3>
<p>Zones, according to usage, may be geographic or seasonal, determined by management compartments of habitats, and positions of paths and and boundaries; zones will be identified, mapped, and monitored for management purposes.</p>
<p>Zones are not easily separated for grazing purposes, and therefore may need to be combined for the purpose. In the past it is likely that shepherds exercised 'management options' by targeting the grazing.</p>

<h3>9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential Conflicts of factors in Management Projects</h3>
<p>The following specific conflicts cross reference to the relevant features. Solutions, or partial solutions, are offered below:</p>
<div class="section" id="bracken-control">
<h4>9.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bracken Control</h4>
<p>Timing of bracken control measures could conflict with a possible dependency on bracken of the silver-blue butterfly, in which it may lay eggs. <em>Cut scattered bracken before flight time</em>, in mid-June.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="asulam">
<h4>9.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asulam</h4>
<p>Desired use of chemical formula, asulam,  by archaeologists for bracken control (trampling -free), and fragility of limestone pavements. Prohibit use of asulam near limestone pavements.</p>
<p>Desired use of asulam by archeologists for bracken control (trampling trampling -free) is poisonous to orchids and fungi. This conflicts with conservation aims, for which trampling of bracken by stock, cutting and grazing of vegetation is preferred to spraying.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Consider and offer alternative controls<ul>
<li>See Feature: <a class="reference external" href="http://cnrm.jakbop,nfshost.com/orme-bracken-pteridium-aquilinum.html">Bracken</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="burns-on-heathland">
<h4>9.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burns on heathland</h4>
<p>Concerning Silver-studded blue butterfly and all reptiles: Summer burns can be beneficial to the butterfly because they remove more of the litter layer than winter burns and promote re-colonisation of heathers of open ground (Ravenscroft 1994). Summer burns may be granted permission under licence. Yet, to reduce chances of reptile loss, cut or burn on a small scale mid-October to mid-February. <em>Compartmental rotations</em> give room to solve this conflict.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grazing-levels">
<h4>9.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grazing levels</h4>
<p>For limestone pavement. grazing levels may be lower than open grassland. Actually, grazing preferences and present flora have probably co-evolved. First, <em>variations in grazing levels</em> need to be monitored in their effects .</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="encouraging-visitors">
<h4>9.1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encouraging visitors</h4>
<p>Encouragement of visitors conflicts with conservation aims. With high visitor numbers, an unknown threshold exists to disturbance and erosion to habitats before recovery is compromised. The problem is compounded with vehicle access. Action to <em>limit numbers of cars or visitors on peak days</em> before recovery is compromised.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scrub-management">
<h4>9.1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scrub management</h4>
<p>A valuable wildlife resource may conflict with management for archaeology. <em>Gradual and limited scrub control.</em></p>

<div class="section" id="farming-future-and-grazing">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farming Future and Grazing</a></h2>
<p>General reduction in stock and rabbit grazing, and selective feeding by sheep, may result in grassland becoming dominated by coarse swards. These changes are usually rapid, within 4 years. The litter of ranker grasses appears to inhibit growth of grassland species, succeeding to scrub.</p>
<p>Medium level stocking rates for Calcerous Grassland = 30 sheep /ha/year. The current levels are low at 1.4 sheep per ha. However, the sheep may feed on grassland in preference to heath, giving a rate of over 4 per ha. Also, exposed sites need lower rates.  Although much grassland is in a favourable condition, suggesting continued sheep grazing at current levels, practices of the past 50 years are relatively recent and may represent sub-optimal management. There are signs of lax grazing. There are implications for current heath renewal.</p>
<p>The future is unclear, given the economic state of upland sheep farming. One farmer has given up grazing rights. Also, The attraction to farmers of keeping sheep on the Gt. Orme may be diminished by large visitor numbers. Should no grazing rights be taken up, or the farms relinquished, then current Management will have to assume responsibility for keeping stock.</p>
<p>Under the current state of affairs, trials in variations in grazing are important. Options for mixed low intensity farming may have beneficial effects on the Gt. Orme's heath and grassland, and yet attract Tir Gofal ('Land Care') grants. Mixed grazing regimes may have been lost on the Orme, and may be explored, using cattle and ponies for targeted grazing effects. The productivity of these beasts, may boost the farms and benefit the local community.</p>

<h3>11.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zones</h3>
<p>According to usage, may be geographic or seasonal, determined by management compartments of habitats, and positions of paths and and boundaries; zones will be identified, mapped, and monitored for management purposes.  Zones are not easily separated for grazing purposes, and therefore may need to be combined for the purpose. In the past it is likely that shepherds exercised 'management options' by targeting the grazing.</p>

<p>Wild cotoneaster, Red Data Book status is 'Endangered', with a threat to its survival in the medium to long term. Measures are currently underway to increase the population to a more secure level as stated in the Summary Species Implementation Plan for Wild Cotoneaster (CCW 1998). The Wild Cotoneaster is also a priority Biodiversity Action Plan species.</p>
<p>All wild plants are protected against unauthorised uprooting under section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act however plants listed under Schedule 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981) are given special protection against picking, uprooting, destruction and sale. Those species on the Red List are species that are threatened with extinction. The threat of extinction has been assessed for these species and they are classified as Extinct, Extinct in the Wild, Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable (using IUCN criteria).</p>
<p>Some other plants fall in to lower risk categories such as near-threatened and nationally scarce species. Near-threatened species are defined as native plants which are not included in the Red List (because they are not declining or threatened but are simply localised in their distribution) but occur in 15 or fewer 10&amp;yen;10km squares in Great Britain. Nationally Scarce species are defined as native plants which occur in 16 to 100 10&amp;yen;10km squares in Great Britain and do not qualify for inclusion in the Red List. However, those plants classified as Nationally Scarce would be included on the Red List if they were judged to be sufficiently threatened.</p>
<p>Surveys and monitoring regimes have been undertaken (and continue) in order to monitor the status of selected rare plants, monitor habitat change and monitor the effects of grazing.</p>

<h3>13.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appendix 5: Policy</h3>
<p><em>Policy, management decisions and Implementation:</em></p>
<p>Responsibility for day to day site management and the implementation of this plan rests with the Country Park Warden within the Countryside Service.
The Local Nature Reserve was declared in November 1981 under sections 19 and 21 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act (1949).</p>
<p>The first strategic planning study of the area, The Great Orme - A Conservation Study, was produced in 1971 by the former Caernarfonshire County Council, &quot;to ensure co-ordination of conservation efforts to achieve both immediate aims and longer term objectives of the two major landowners&quot;, Mostyn Estates and what was then the Llandudno Urban District Council. Full time wardens were also considered essential for these provisions to be effective. Considerable grant aid was to be made available from the Countryside Commission to facilitate implementation of proposals.</p>
<p>Great Orme's Head received official Country Park status through designation by the Countryside Commission in 1978. The site has been managed as a Country Park from August 1980 commencing with the appointment of a Warden.</p>
<p>Policy and management decisions are channelled through the Working Party. The Working Party comprises representatives from:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Conwy County Borough Council (Officers and Councillors)</li>
<li>Mostyn Estates</li>
<li>Countryside Council for Wales</li>
<li>Gwynedd Archaeological Trust</li>
<li>Llandudno Town Council</li>
<li>Local Grazier</li>
</ul>
<p>The management of the site as a recreational resource became more structured following the introduction of the initial comprehensive Management Plan in 1985. The Management Plan is updated and revised on a five-yearly basis.</p>
