  Introduction, Land-use Diversification, Wales
  <a class="anchor" href="#introduction-land-use-diversification-wales">#</a>
</h1>
<p>UK farming is experiencing problems of economics and sustainability. This includes ‘<em>less favoured</em>’ areas, which cover much of Wales.</p>
<p>Less favoured areas are over 240 metres, a category of hills and uplands which are less suitable for arable farming and prime pasture. Uplands represent 32% of Britain.</p>
<p>The Welsh uplands produce hardy stock and their role is important in the overall sheep farming system. They are considered to be overstocked by conservation bodies. Keeping the status quo as a production system or museum is unsustainable. It is probably undesirable overall. Diversification has a number of avenues. Productive woodlands can be profitable on some uplands.
Farmers’ strategic decisions may favour diversification. They need the best available advice in making changes. Alternative low intensive, bio-diverse, silvo-agriculture brings long term benefits and are appealing. Farmers need alternative income to headage payments.</p>
<p>There are funding issues however, with loss of headage subsidies, and lack of agricultural and forest integration, with policy divides. Land use modification Incentives for trees are aimed mainly at fenced large continuous woodland. Policy levers lies in the hands of NAW, and Manweb, Maff and Mentor Powys and Tir Gofal (meaning, &lsquo;<em>land Care</em>’) in administering the Woodland Grant Scheme. Most land is &ldquo;<em>undesignated</em>&rdquo; status. These problems are increasingly recognised, along with the fact that tourists visit Wales for reasons of nature, biodiversity and woodland.</p>
<p><em>A Shelterwoods Trees Scheme</em> is part of an agroforestry initiative, to allow dispersed trees on farmland for animal welfare and biodiversity. They do not have to be fenced, and so do not consequentially increase stocking densities. Individual trees may need protection in their early establishment.</p>

<p>Since the 1970&rsquo;s Walnut trees have only been planted in agroforestry systems such as protective strips of 1-2 rows, in alleys for soil protection, along roads, around farms, along irrigation canals and around field borders (spacing in alleys at 8-10m). These are now well developed, have strong balloon shaped crowns, fruits well and are not prone to pests and disease.</p>

<p>Provenance trials were established in several parts of Switzerland just after the First and Second World Wars. They were not successful and abandoned early on, with one exception. It was clear the genetic material was poor. It is believed that the genetic material has deteriorated in Europe because of selection for fruit growing in orchards. Great variety in germplasm exists in the natural fruit forests of Central Asia. This is suitable for trials.
Now Switzerland aims to create highly structured, economically valuable and biologically diverse forests using walnut. Other functions include the protection of dangers found in alpine country, such as erosion, flooding, avalanche, and nature conservation. At lower elevations (below 800 m above sea level) sites are fertile and provide excellent growing conditions for broadleaf timber such as oak (<em>quercus spp.</em>), ash (<em>fraxinus excelsior</em>), maple (<em>Acer spp.</em>) and cherry (<em>Prunus avium</em>). Small provenance experiments in Britain were not conclusive (Kerr 1993).</p>

  Benefits of Walnut
  <a class="anchor" href="#benefits-of-walnut">#</a>
</h1>
<p>Walnut (<em>Juglans regia</em>) is interesting because it may contribute to a high biodiversity and higher value production. Suitable for top storey of multi-storey systems, walnut’s fruits are nutritious. The plant has medicinal properties. The timber is valuable. It is used in silvopasture, offering livestock shade and protection, as well as excellent forage for livestock..</p>
<p>Its fruits were carried by the Roman Army. The Romans are perhaps responsible for naming British people &lsquo;<em>Welsch</em>&rsquo;, meaning keepers of the welsch, the Germanic name for the walnut tree, and the name given to walnut-growing people and district in North Italy today.</p>
<p>Walnut has medicinal properties. Bark and leaves have alterative, laxative, astringent and detergent properties. It is used for skin troubles (E.g. herpes, eczema), and as a purgative for irritable bowel. It is said to delay hardening of arteries, indigestion, eczema, inflamed eyelids</p>
<p>Walnut has other uses: Crushed walnut leaves are an insect repellent. Its oil was once used instead of butter and olive oil in France, and it is popular as salad and cooking oil. The husks produce a dark yellow dye for colouring wood, hair and wool. It was used by fictional heroes for disguise. The lemon scented leaves deter insects. In England and Wales, horses were once commonly rested under Walnut trees away from annoying flies.</p>
<h2 id="timber-properties">
  Timber Properties
  <a class="anchor" href="#timber-properties">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Walnut timber is pliable, has high tensile strength, medium weight, fine and fibrous but inelastic it requires long seasoning it is easily worked, polishes well. Trees were lost to Britain with imports and fashions in mahogany.</p>
<h2 id="timber-value">
  Timber Value
  <a class="anchor" href="#timber-value">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Walnut produces the most demanded and valuable timber. Its price has been stable for the last fifty or more years. Prices are always at least three times as high than for oak or cherry. Walnut is faster growing than all other high quality timber. Stems of 60 cm at breast height may be produced in a 60 to 70 year rotation. Cherry and ash need 80-90 years and oak 140-50 years. Thus compared to oak 200% of volume and 600% of value in the same time.</p>

  Determining Suitable Land
  <a class="anchor" href="#determining-suitable-land">#</a>
</h1>
<p>A map was required with the following characteristics: potentially suitable soils, below a maximum altitude of 600 metres, facing in a southerly aspect, and on slopes within a specified slope of between 5 and 35%.</p>
<p>Use of Ecological Site Classification(ESC) and Natural Vegetation Class (NVC) is a way of proceeding. These are entered into a GIS system. However, for walnut trials, the ESC is not definite in the UK. Instead, parameters were taken from research world-wide. Area data files were used for land use, soils, and demography, from the dataset &lsquo;SNP&rsquo;, covering Snowdonia National Park, North Wales. Refer to Appendix: &lsquo;<em>Map Legends</em>&rsquo; for full legend, before the extraction sub-maps.</p>

This includes a 45 :sup:<code>o</code> overlap either side of each direction, i.e between E (90 :sup:<code>o</code>) and SSW (225 :sup:<code>o</code>).

Thus scatted pixels need to be grouped (command: &lsquo;clump&rsquo;), and the isolated pixels or, &lsquo;noise&rsquo; removed.</p>
<p>For the purpose, areas of less than two hectares were removed by creating a Boolean mask (&lsquo;WNg4&rsquo;) from the map &lsquo;SNPground&rsquo;. The map WNg4 was then crossed back to remove undesired areas (coded 0) from SNPground,, the desired areas&rsquo; value = 1 being reassigned with values for each soil class so as not to lose information on soil type.</p>

  Conclusions, Potential for Woodland

</h1>
<p>There exists some potential in the area for planting walnut. Forest has become fragmented over centuries. The outcome is a cultural landscape. Radical change may not be an plausible or desirable. However, Economic pressures and unsustainable monoculture do require change.</p>
<p>Diversification of land use needs to include products which are in demand, where value can be added, and which have by- products. Demands are changing.</p>
<p>There are good reasons for trying Walnut. There are objections, because of expectations concerning walnuts growth. Trials should be aimed at testing new germplasm. Potentially suitable sites need to be found. Interrogation of land maps with GIS has helped to broadly find our targets. Owners could be approached. Walnut may serve as livestock shelter in any case.</p>
<p>Grass communities may diversify with the addition of trees in clumps, and the micro-climatic variations that occur with trees. Quality of pasture is an issue here.</p>
<p>The size of plots would need to be determined before trials, and this could be achieved by interrogating the resultant maps. Suitability should be determined, finally, on the ground.</p>
<p>Objectives of conservation can be served at the same time, by linking woodland with corridors, and build upon what is already there. Dormice require 50 ha of uninterrupted woodland, the Marsh Tit, 25 ha; the Nuthatch 100 ha., species which are on the conservation lists.</p>
<p>Zones of existing scrub and mixed woodland could be protected with buffer zones of scattered trees. At this time 15% of the land is wooded and over 70% of that is conifer plantation.</p>
